## üîç How TruthScan Works

TruthScan employs a multi-faceted approach to analyzing news content:

   - Site-specific extraction logic for popular news sites like BBC, Al Jazeera, and Times of India.

2. **Text Analysis**
   - The content is analyzed for indicators of potential misinformation:
     - **Sensational Language**: Identifies hyperbolic, emotionally charged language commonly used in clickbait.
     - **Source Attribution**: Evaluates whether the article cites credible sources.
     - **Content Depth**: Assesses the substance and thoroughness of the reporting.

3. **Result Generation**
   - The analysis produces a verdict (real, fake, or uncertain) with a confidence score.
   - Detailed explanation of the factors that contributed to the verdict.
   - Visual indicators of result reliability through color-coded confidence meters.

## üß† Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

The application uses a Flask-based backend with the following components:

- **Web Scraping Module**: Utilizes BeautifulSoup4 to extract article content from URLs with specialized handling for different news sites.
- **Text Analysis Engine**: Implements rule-based algorithms to detect patterns associated with fake news.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API design for handling verification requests and returning structured results.

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built with modern web technologies:

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using Bootstrap 5.
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time feedback and visual indicators for verification results.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive client-side validation and error messaging.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Disclaimer

- The system uses rule-based detection which, while effective, is not infallible.
- Always cross-check information with multiple reliable sources.
- URL extraction may not work perfectly on all websites due to variations in HTML structure.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Integration with external fact-checking databases
- Support for vernacular languages prevalent in the India-Pakistan region
- Machine learning-based classification for higher accuracy
- User accounts to save verification history
- Browser extension for one-click verification
