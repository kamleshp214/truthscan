   - Advanced filtering removes ads, navigation, and other non-article elements.

2. **Text Analysis**
   - The content is analyzed for indicators of potential misinformation:
     - **Sensational Language**: Identifies hyperbolic, emotionally charged language commonly used in clickbait.
     - **Source Attribution**: Evaluates whether the article cites credible sources.
     - **Content Depth**: Assesses the substance and thoroughness of the reporting.

3. **Result Generation**
   - The analysis produces a verdict (real, fake, or uncertain) with a confidence score.
   - Detailed explanation of the factors that contributed to the verdict.
